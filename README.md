Welcome and thank you for cloning this repository.

Please run ```bundle install``` to install the gems.

Then run ```rails s``` to start the server.

Please see below the two paths that has the JSON data of the API:
Teams - ```http://localhost:3000/api/v1/teams```

Players - ```http://localhost:3000/api/v1/players```

Please note that in order to use this API, the rails server needs to be up and running.

Then after cloning the Nba-List repository, please run ```npm start``` to start the server in the react side.

The console should prompt a message asking if you want to start the local host on a different port (i.e. 3001 instead of 3000).

After typing yes, you should be able to see the app!
